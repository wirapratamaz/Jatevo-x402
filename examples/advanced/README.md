# Advanced Examples

This directory contains advanced examples for specific use cases that are not typical for most developers.

## Browser Wallet Integration

`solana-browser.html` - Demonstrates how to integrate Phantom/Solflare wallet in a browser environment. This is useful for:
- Building dApps that run entirely in the browser
- Creating frontend applications with direct wallet connectivity
- Testing wallet integrations

Note: Most developers using the x402 API will be building server-side applications and should refer to the main examples directory for typical usage patterns.
